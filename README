# `ll-rb-tree`  
`ll-rb-tree` is an implementation of a data structure called "Left-leaning Red-black Tree". 

The structure resembles a usual Red-Black tree, while aiming at reducing and simplifying the codebase.

Unlike lots of another implementations ([here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/left-leaning-red-black-tree-insertion/) and [here, in russian](http://neerc.ifmo.ru/wiki/index.php?title=%D0%9B%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%BE-%D1%87%D1%91%D1%80%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5_%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8C%D1%8F) ) of this data structure, `ll-rb-tree` actually supports deletion.

The codebase was reviewed and checked in the testing system.

## Features
* `insert`
* `erase`
* `lower_bound`
* `find`
* iterators, `begin()`, `end()`
* initalizing from `std::initializer_list`
* copy constructor
